# COMP551A1
In this project, we were tasked to implement two different classification models to predict the diagnosis of two diseases; Hepatitis and Diabetes, using two datasets containing
Messidor image sets and a Hepatitis symptomatic attributes
dataset. The goal is to find the model with the highest accuracy and the best pair of features. We built the KNN models
using hyper-parameter settings with distance functions and
normalised the features so that they would have equal weight
when calculating the distance which we found could potentially impact the performance significantly. Similarly we
constructed the Decision tree over hyper-parameter settings
on depth, cost function and minimum leaf instances. We
evaluated our models using K-fold validation techniques to
ensure the consistent performance of our models. We found
that our KNN approach achieved a better accuracy which
reported a test accuracy score of 93.8% on the final test set
in the Hepatitis dataset and a test accuracy score of 69.6%
on the Messidor dataset. In comparison to the decision tree
model with a test accuracy score of 68.8% for the Hepatitis
dataset and a test accuracy score of 65.2% for the Messidor
dataset.
